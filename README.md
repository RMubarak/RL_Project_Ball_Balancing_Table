# RL_Project_Ball_Balancing_Table
CS 5180 - Reinforcement Learning and Sequential Decision Making April 2024 Project: Modeling and Controlling a Ball Balancing Table
Students: Ramez Mubarak, Kruthika Gangaraju

In this project, we will be modeling a ball balancing table (https://acrome.net/product/ball-balancing-table) from scratch and writing a controller for it using classical RL algorithms such as Monte Carlo control, Q-Learning, and Expected SARSA. 

Please refer to the pdf report for project description and process.
